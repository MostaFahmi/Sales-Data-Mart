# Sales Data Mart Development Overview:

- **Objective:** Created a Sales Data Mart to streamline data management and support informed decision-making.

- **Star Schema Model:** Designed a robust star schema, featuring dedicated tables for `Product`, `Customer`, `Date`, and `Territory`.

- **SSIS Integration:** Utilized SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to implement efficient Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes.

- **Table Components:**
  - `Product Table:` Centralized product-related information for comprehensive analysis.
  - `Customer Table:` Consolidated customer data for enhanced insights and reporting.
  - `Date Table:` Facilitated time-based analysis and reporting with a dedicated date dimension.
  - `Territory Table:` Enabled region-specific analytics and reporting.

- **SSIS Packages:**
  - Developed SSIS packages for seamless integration of data from diverse sources into the data mart.
  - Implemented incremental loading and Change Data Capture (CDC) strategies for efficiency.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Employed SQL Server optimization techniques, including indexing for enhanced query performance.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:**
  - Designed the data mart for scalability, with loading the fact_sales by the incremental technique

- **User-friendly Reporting:**
  - Integrated the data mart with reporting tools, providing stakeholders with an intuitive interface for insightful reporting.

This initiative showcases my expertise in SQL Server and SSIS, delivering a powerful data solution that aligns with organizational goals and enhances data-driven decision-making capabilities.
